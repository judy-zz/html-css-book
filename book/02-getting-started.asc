Despite a host of IDEs footnote:[Integrated Development Environments.] on the market, you really only need two things for HTML/CSS creation:

* A text editor.
* A web browser.

That's it. Now, that doesn't mean you should overlook any IDEs that look good to you. In fact, you may find me using one in the next few years if it comes out with exactly the features I need. You never know; things change. But for the current state of development, I'm going to tell you my opinion on the most efficient toolset for HTML & CSS development. It's pretty similar to the above list, really:

* A text editor.
* A web browser.
* A web development toolchain.

We've been doing websites for a long time without the web development toolchain. You could still develop without it. But you wouldn't want to. Not anymore.
