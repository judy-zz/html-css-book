Introduction
============

First: I am a highly opinionated person. Many people do web design and development with very different tools and platforms. I've evaulated many of these different perspectives, but I will be presenting a few different setups that I think will be most helpful, educational, and professional for you. For any visual layout, other developers will have found over a hundred different ways of completing it; I will attempt to give you a few solid, memorable techniques and thinking patterns as a platform for you to build on. I can't write this book to teach you how to build every possible kind of website, but my hope is that by the time you've read and practiced this book, you will feel confident attacking any problem with techniques you're able to use from memory.

You will _practice_ the techniques presented in this book, because practice truly makes perfect. You will write down notable methods that I give you, not so you can remember them later, but so you can remember them _now_. And by the time you feel like you're truly comfortable developing HTML and CSS on your own, you will disagree with my recommendations in this book; I encourage and welcome you to.

HTML and CSS development is a fluid and changing river. This book is the raft that I've painfully built over several years of frustrating trial and error, and I hope I've built it large enough to include all of you in it. I expect that this raft will not hold itself together for very long. Many of the techniques presented within will not hold themselves up over time, perhaps not even until the publication of this book, before better techniques rise up to take their place. I expect to update this work frequently to stay on top of these changes, and I hope that you'll notify me when pieces of this raft fall apart, so I can keep it together for longer.

== My setup

WARNING: This could (and will) change at any moment. By the time this book publishes, it will probably be out of date.

On occasion, I'll update my http://clinton.j-udy.com[blog] with updates on my current working setup, should you hope to replicate it yourself. I welcome your critiques!

=== Chasing the demon

I am constantly changing my toolset, to stay on top of new software and techniques that people proclaim to be the next big thing. _DON'T DO THIS._ Learn the tools and techniques that people use, but pick a good toolset to start (using this book!) and then master it.

When you become a master, you'll already have the appropriate HTML and CSS in mind as you develop the code behind the website. Your toolset only serves to extract the code in your brain to the computer. It should only serve to help you in that process, and not ever become a hurdle.

This is why it's so important to find one simple, unintrusive tool

=== Specifics

I do all of my development on a MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Lion. I use iTerm as a terminal emulator, running my own custom theme for zshell. footnote:[You should be able to find it on my http://judy.github.com[github page], if you feel so inclined.] I use Sublime Text 2 as a text editor, and both Sublime and iTerm are running a Monokai-based theme for visual consistency. I use the latest version of Google Chrome, with Chrome's built-in developer tools, but I also test against Firefox.

I have Breeze installed for easy window management; it easily lets me assign my various windows to different screens or halves of the screen so I can maximize window space. I use git as my version control system.

I also have a home-built PC running Windows 7 that I use for more processor-intensive work, like Photoshop or Illustrator. I use http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester[DebugBar's IE Tester] for testing against multiple different versions of Internet Explorer, and my PC also has Windows versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

The monitor for my PC doubles as a second screen for my MacBook Pro; buttons on the monitor labeled "1" and "2" easily switch between the Mac and the PC.

In the near future, I'm planning on acquiring a cheap Android device and an iPad for testing mobile pages on those devices.
